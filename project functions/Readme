Welcome to Ahmed’s HCTSA project to analyse the local field potential of flies
For Analyses replication, you would require to download the folder “Data” including the folder within it, as well using Matlab version 2018a, installing HCTSA package, specifically version (V.099) and libsvm package for classification
from the following links:

(1) https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa/releases
(2) https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/oldfiles/index-1.0.html


As soon as you install these packages, now you can start your analysis, while data is separated into two folders Dror flies for training data and Rihanon files for validation data; you can manipulate the data using the scripts and functions in project function folder to:

The main functions simply operate by indicating whether 0 to avoid computation or 1 to compute in a Job structure file type
Also require to specify the requested channel and operation  in a allocate structure file type

Main functions:

(1)batchPreprocess: responsible for carrying out pre-processing steps
1)	Removelinenoise and apply tapers[3,5]
2)	Detrend data
3)	Normalize time-series using z-score
4)	calculate power spectrum using [get_power] function

Job.remlinenoise 
Job.detrend
Job.zscore
Job.powersc

allocate.fly;
allocate.channel;
 allocate.trial;


[datafdn] = batchPreprocess(Job,allocate,params)






(2) batchClassify

 1)  total average svm thresholds for the 13 cross validation
 
 2) dirction of the operation

3) classification accuracy
 
3) prediction of the validation data

(3) Batch_analysis
[svm_c,accuracy,lol_threshold,direction,predict]= batchClassify(Job,params,allocate)


(3) Compute batchPreprocess and Batch_analysis sequentially.

:-        Job.predict=  1  
          Job.classify=   1


 allocate.channel;
 allocate.operation;
allocate.datatype


[svm_c,accuracy,lol_threshold,direction,predict]= batch_analysis(Job,params,allocate)
